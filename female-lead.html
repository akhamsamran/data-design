		<h1>Choosing a Strong Female Lead</h1>
		<p>The best candidate to play the part of a “strong female lead” need be neither strong nor female. Both the competence and professionalism of the candidates must be taken into consideration before hiring for this role. Being a good actor supersedes being strong and female, and bringing the right attitude to the job may trump acting talent.</p>
		<p>When considering an applicant for this role, it is important to evaluate whether the actor can fulfil the specific requirements of this character, both physically and performance-wise.  Can they look like the person they are supposed to play, and if not, can they be made-up to look appropriately?  The artistic and story must be pushed forward by this actor, so it is important that they have the acting skills to perform the part.  If this actor has the competence and “look” to do this, then they are eligible as an actor to fill the role.  However, this is not the only thing to take into account as professionalism must also be considered.</p>
		<p>An actor who is brilliant as an actor, but who is difficult to work with for any reason, might be worse as a choice for hire than a less brilliant actor who is easy to work with.  Being late, unpleasant to other crew and cast, being high-maintenance, or having other antisocial tendencies can cause cost overruns, bad morale on set, and may not be worth the talent that such an actor brings to a role. </p>
		<p>A highly talented strong female actor might seem the best person for the role as strong female lead, but a professional, enthusiastic man should not be ruled out if they are a better fit.</p>
